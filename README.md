I am a **systems engineer, tech lead, and founder** focused on building **trusted digital infrastructure** using **AI and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)**.

My work spans **financial systems, provenance, identity, healthcare, and developer education**, with a strong emphasis on **regulatory-grade architectures**, real-world deployment, and explainable systems for institutions in the Philippines. Former counter-terrorism consultant.

I believe:
> **AI may assist judgment — but verifiable systems must remain the source of truth.**

## What I’m Building Toward

I’m focused on contributing to a future where:

- Trust is **embedded into systems**, not assumed
- AI assists humans but does not override **verifiable truth**
- Distributed ledgers **support regulators**, not bypass them
- Filipino developers can **compete globally while solving local problems**

I’m especially interested in collaborations involving:
- Financial infrastructure
- Provenance & traceability
- Digital identity
- AI + governance
- Developer education at scale
